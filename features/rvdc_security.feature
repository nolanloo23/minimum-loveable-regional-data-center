  in order to protect data in transit as well as at rest


Scenario: where an Accor Security Engineer is extending corporate cyber-security controls to a RVDC
  Given one "Accor Security Engineer"
  When in real time basis
  Then Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to our environment.
  Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.

Scenario: where an Accor Security Engineer is extending corporate cyber-security controls to a RVDC
  Given one "Accor Security Engineer"
  When deploying a new service
  Then Apply security at all layers, deploy the new infrastructure in VPC with private subnets for the services that they don't need to be exposed to the internet,
  chose multi AZ deployement for high avaialabilty.



# Scenario: where an Accor Security Engineer is extending corporate cyber-security controls to a RVDC
#   Given one "Accor Security Engineer"
#   When there is a need to remove unnecessary credentials
#   Then if you created an IAM user for an application that does not use the console, then the IAM user
#   does not need a password. Similarly, if a user only uses the console, remove their access keys.
