Feature: connecting RVDC services

  As a Network Engineer,
  I collect and analyse RDVC network traffic
  in order to optimize the network configuration and be better prepared for faults.

Scenario: where an  Network Engineer is connecting a RVDC to the  corporate infrastructure
  Given one "Network Engineer"
  When on daily basis 
  Then Lunch network scanner to check network system, operating system and applications running on your network to identify vulnerabilities
  and possible security flaws that could expose your network to security compromise.

Scenario: where a Network Engineer is connecting a RVDC to the  corporate infrastructure
  Given one "Network Engineer"
  When there is a degradation in the performance of over time
  Then Go to system's monitoring logs to identify the source of the degradation and remediate internal or external factors, such as the operating system or application load.
